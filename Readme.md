# Bikes Front-End application

Here's a front end development assessment that we'd like for you to complete in approximately one week.  

## The task
We estimate that this task will take about **6 hours** of contiguous development.  Feel free to develop in a non-contiguous manner.  
If you start to go way over time then just submit what you have and create a list in your project's **README.md** of anything else that would have liked to add/do given the time.

### Details
To complete this task, you must:
- read the user story below and create a single webpage application to fulfil the requirements of the story
- create a github repository for the task where you will **continuously** commit your code
- create a **index.html** file to contain your project's main code
- create a project **README.md** where you'll put your project description, notes, assumptions etc...
- design the front end as you see fit
- when finished send over the GitHub repo and any other links

#### The User story
As a user,
Assuming I have access to a modern web browser (chrome) with an internet connection and I am visiting the page
- I would like to see a list/grid of bikes (taken from the bike data URL below)
- I would like to see a the name, an image, a description and the class for each bike
- I would like to be able to sort the bikes into a custom order based on class
- I would like my custom order to be saved and not change when I refresh the page

A JSON object with all the relevant bike data is available at, feel free to call that URL directly from your page or host it on your server if you're using one: [https://jujhar.com/bikes.json](https://jujhar.com/bikes.json)

### Assumptions:
- Your project must work in the latest version of Google Chrome, you can ignore all other browsers
- Please list any other assumptions you may have made
- Feel free to use/not use any JS libraries/frameworks
- Feel free to use/not use any HTML/CSS frameworks
- If you have the time then host the page on a server/service of your choice and put the link in your **README.md**

### Assessment Criteria
Your application will be assessed on the following criteria (in order of importance):

- Approach
- Code organisation, commenting and use of GitHub
- Maintainability
- Choice of frameworks
- UX
- Flair
- *bonus points* if you can host the page and it's dependencies on your own server

We're trying to see your thought processes with this task. What's more important to us is how you approach the task, rather than the actual final output itself.

Looking forward to seeing your project :-)
